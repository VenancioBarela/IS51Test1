"""
The program is trying to determin which payment option is better (more money)
First option is 100 dollars per day for 10 days. the second option is 1 dollars 
a day with it being doubled each day for the 10 days. There will be two functions to calculate the rate of pay.
function 1 will calculate the amount for the first option, function 2 will calculate for the second option.

function1 will output 100 (dollars) * 10 (days)
function2 will loop 10 times, doubling the amount and add it to the total.

if the amount is equal, we output to the user  "option 1 and option 2 are the same".
if option1 is better, we output to the user "option 1 is better".
if the option2 is better, we output to the user "option 2 is better".
